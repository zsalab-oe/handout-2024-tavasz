## Waterfall

<img src="../images/waterfall.png" class="img-right">

- Sequential design process
- Next stage can be started after finishing the previous
- After finishing a step, cannot go back to previous

<!-- vertical -->

## Waterfall: pros

- Customer can have clear expectation about the final product
- Employee turnover does not influence project due to strong documentation
- Simple, easy to use model

<!-- vertical -->

## Waterfall: cons

- Customer can have clear expectation about the final product

## The Agile Manifesto

<!-- .slide: class="slide-quote" -->

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration over** contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change over** following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Agile Principles

- Frequent delivery
- Test early, test often
- Small, incremental releases
- Development team makes their own decisions
- Direct communication between customer and development team

<!-- vertical -->

## Best Practices for Agile

- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Regular refactoring
- Continuous integration

## SCRUM

> A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

- Not a process or technique, rather a framework
- Based on empirical process theory
- Empiricism assumes that knowledge comes from experience
- Iterative, incremental approach
- Consists of
    - Scrum Team/Roles
    - Events
    - Artifacts
    - Rules

## Scrum Team & Roles

<img src="../lectures/images/scrum_communication_modell.drawio.png" class="img-right">

- Self-organizing
- Cross-functional
- Maximizes opportunities for feedback

- Roles:
    - Product Owner (PO)

    - Scrum Master
- [Further reading](https://www.scrumhub.com/scrum-guide/team-roles/)

<!-- vertical -->

## Product Owner

- Cross-functional team – team has all skills needed turn Product Backlog into potentially releasable functionalities
- No titles inside team
- No subteams inside team
- Size can be between 3 and 9

<!-- vertical -->

## Cross-functional team

![](../images/cross_functional.png)

Akkor tud egy csapat „cross-functional” lenni, ha minden tagja kellőképpen érti a csapat feladatát, így a tagok képesek egymást helyettesíteni. A fenti ábra a csapattagok tudását szemlélteti. Az első esetben csupán elenyésző általános tudással rendelkező emberekről van szó, akik egy nagyon szűk területet ismernek. A *cross-functional team* esetében is megvan az egyes tagok specifikus tudása ám az kevésbé nyúlik túl a csapat általános ismeretein és kevésbé specifikusabb is.

## Scrum vs. Kanban

|                     | SCRUM                        | Kanban          |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Cadence             | Regular fixed length sprints | Continuous flow |
| Release methodology | At the end of each sprint if approved by the product owner | Continuous delivery or at the team's discretion |
| Roles               | Product owner, scrum master, development team | No existing roles. Some teams enlist the help of an agile coach.|
| Change philosophy   | Teams should strive to not make changes to the sprint forecast during the sprint. Doing so compromises learnings around estimation.| Change can happen at any time |

<!-- ## Az Egyetem más tárgyhoz fejlesztett e-tananyaga SCRUM-hoz

- Elérhető [innen](http://innovacio.uni-obuda.hu/p/elearning/)

- Teljes más a struktúrája mint az SzFMV tárgynak, de kifejezetten hasznos részeket is tartalmaz mint pl. a Product owner / 4. modul: user story szétbontása
